# TDS GPT Reviewer

After the later parts of this course's contents were written, we ran it through a [Technical Content Reviewer GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6777656ed3b8819187b6f17d9f343853-technical-content-reviewer).

Take a look at the GPT's instructions. These were generated by the [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation) tool.
