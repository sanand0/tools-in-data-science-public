- **Keyword Search**: Use the search function to find Wikipedia pages containing a specific keyword, limiting results with the results argument.
- **Fetching Summaries**: Use the summary function to get a concise summary of a Wikipedia page, limiting sentences with the sentences argument.
- **Retrieving Full Pages**: Use the page function to obtain the full content of a Wikipedia page, including sections and references.
- **Accessing URLs**: Retrieve the URL of a Wikipedia page using the url attribute of the page object.
- **Extracting References**: Use the references attribute to get all reference links from a Wikipedia page.
