# AI Coding Online

Modern AI coding tools have transformed how we build software, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment through natural language interfaces. This module covers the mindset shift toward "vibe-coding" and the essential tools for AI-assisted development.

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Inline AI coding sandboxes**: Use Claude Artifacts, Gemini Canvas, and ChatGPT Canvas for iterative development
- **Hosted agent workbenches**: Leverage Replit Agent, Bolt.new, and Lovable for end-to-end app creation

## Artifacts: Inline AI coding sandboxes

AI artifacts provide side-by-side code and chat interfaces that revolutionize how we iterate on applications. These tools show visible diffs, run code in real-time, and allow for conversational editing.

### Claude Artifacts

[Claude Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them) creates interactive content in a dedicated window alongside your conversation. It automatically generates artifacts for significant, self-contained content over 15 lines.

Claude creates artifacts for documents, code snippets, HTML websites, SVG images, diagrams, and React components. You can edit, iterate, and export your creations directly from the interface.

**Key features:**

- Version tracking with rollback capabilities
- Real-time preview for web applications
- Direct export to files or clipboard
- Support for AI-powered apps with Claude API integration

**Best for:** Complex React components, data visualizations, and interactive prototypes requiring multiple iterations.

### Gemini Canvas and ChatGPT Canvas

[Gemini Canvas](https://gemini.google/overview/canvas/) and [ChatGPT Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/) provide similar side-by-side editing experiences with their respective AI models.

These platforms excel at collaborative editing where you can highlight specific sections for targeted changes, making them ideal for documentation, code refactoring, and educational content.

**Best for:** Document editing, code explanations, and collaborative writing tasks.

## Online Coding Agents

These platforms combine AI agents with full development environments, handling everything from initial scaffolding to deployment. They're perfect for 0-to-demo workflows and sharing prototypes.

### Replit Agent

[Replit Agent](https://docs.replit.com/replitai/agent) is an AI-powered coding assistant that works within Replit's browser-based IDE. It can create complete applications from natural language descriptions, handle file editing, run code, and deploy applications.

The agent understands your project context and can make complex, multi-file changes. It integrates with Replit's deployment system, allowing you to share working applications instantly.

**Key features:**

- Complete app generation from descriptions
- Multi-file editing and project management
- Integrated deployment and sharing
- Real-time collaboration capabilities
- Mobile app support for coding on-the-go

**Best for:** Full-stack applications, educational projects, and rapid prototyping with immediate deployment needs.

### Lovable

[Lovable](https://docs.lovable.dev/) is an AI web builder that creates full-stack applications from natural language descriptions. It's designed for users of any skill level and focuses on producing deployable web applications.

Lovable excels at creating business applications, landing pages, and functional web tools. It provides templates and integrations to accelerate development beyond basic prototyping.

**Key features:**

- Natural language to full-stack application
- Template library for common use cases
- Built-in integrations (payments, auth, databases)
- Professional deployment options
- No-code/low-code approach

**Best for:** Business applications, landing pages, and functional web tools that need professional deployment.

### Jules (Google)

[Jules](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-jules-ai-assistant) is Google's multi-agent coding environment announced at Google Cloud Next '25 with team-based tiers. It combines a shared workspace, orchestration primitives, and a live execution runtime so agents can collaborate on data and application tasks.

Jules now offers a CLI and API for scripting agent workflows, plus deep integrations with Vertex AI, BigQuery, and Workspace. Builders can define guardrails, share reusable playbooks, and hand off tasks between agents who stay in sync through a shared memory layer.

**Key features:**

- Multi-agent workspace with live whiteboard, task queue, and reviewer roles ([Google Cloud blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-jules-ai-assistant), [Google Cloud Next '25 recap](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/next-25-build-with-jules))
