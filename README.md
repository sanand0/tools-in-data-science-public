# Tools in Data Science - Sep 2025

[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches
popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.

<details>
<summary><strong>Anyone can audit this course. It's public</strong></summary>

Anyone can access this course content for free and submit assessments.

Those auditing can [use GitHub notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/subscriptions-and-notifications/get-started/configuring-notifications) and watch activity on the [course repository](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/).

Enrolled [IITM students](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) can additionally participate in [Discourse](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34), get projects evaluated, take the final end-term, and get a certificate.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>This is a practical course. Doing. No theory</strong></summary>

The focus is: What **tools** should I use for what? How do I use them?

It covers **real-life** scenarios like:

- Scraping _messy_ data, instead of being given clean data.
- Using _existing_ models, instead of training your own.
- Writing a `sed` + `grep` _script_ in minutes, instead of a log parser over weeks.

<summary><strong>This course is hard. Take it in your last term</strong></summary>

[40% of the Jan 2025 batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268).

Here's students' feedback from past terms:

- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.

**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-09-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.

But the learnings may be worth the effort.

- [May 2025 feedback](feedback-2025-05.md) indicates that students know it's hard -- and still rate the learning high.

<summary><strong>Programming skills are a pre-requisite</strong></summary>

You need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, REST, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.

**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers, too. Data scientists source, clean, transform, visualize, and deploy programmatically.

Sometimes, specialists do this work (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But often, you need to write your own code.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Don't re-enroll if you passed. Your marks won't improve</strong></summary>

Re-taking this course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625).

The course is public, so you can always audit it for learning.

<summary><strong>Skip the content. Just take assessments</strong></summary>

Few people read the content, at least based on this course's stats.

Just take the assessment. If a question is unclear, and you can't solve it in any faster way, read the content which is just above each question.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Copying & ChatGPT are allowed and encouraged</strong></summary>

You _CAN_ copy from friends and LLMs. You can work in groups. You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...

You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final in-person end-term exam).

- **Why copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.
- **To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.
- **To learn better, share** what you've learnt. Learn from others' feedback.

<summary><strong>Check system requirements</strong></summary>

Check [system-requirements.md](system-requirements.md) for permissions you need, software to install, and websites to access. You may need to speak with your system administrator for access.

Updates:

- **23 Sep 2025**: We swapped modules 2 & 3. Deployment Tools is now _before_ AI coding - because the AI coding graded assignment needs deployment. Dates revised:
  - GA2 release is on 24 Sep (was 18 Sep).
  - GA3 release is on 1 Oct (was 25 Sep)

### Notes

- **[Graded Assignment 1][GA1] checks course pre-requisites**. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.
- **Remote Online Exam is _hard_**. Tests implicit learning. [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/roe-prep-discussion-thread-tds-may-2025/181581/25)
- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. Tests your memory. It's easy.
- **Projects test application**. Tests how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.
- **We may post bonus activities on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)
- **Subjective evaluations use LLMs**. LLMs may evaluate you differently each time. Learn to answer them _robustly_. LLM decisions are **final**.
