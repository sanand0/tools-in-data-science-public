<details>
<summary><strong>You MUST know Python, JavaScript, APIs, etc.</strong></summary>

You need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, APIs, Excel, ChatGPT, and data science concepts.

Try [Graded Assignment 1][GA1]. Drop it if you score low.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>It's a practical course. Just get it done. "How" matter less.</strong></summary>

The course models **real-life**. Unclear problems, messy data, ridiculous deadlines, limited support.

Find your own unique ways of solving the problems. There's no one right approach.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>It's a hard course. Take it in your last IITM BS Diploma term.</strong></summary>

It's good for learning, maybe not for grades.

- In Jan 2025, [40% of the batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268).
- [The ROE is intentionally impossible][hard]

Here's students' feedback from past terms:

- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.

**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-09-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.

But the learnings may be worth the effort.

- [May 2025 feedback](feedback-2025-05.md) indicates that students know it's hard -- and still rate the learning high.

<summary><strong>Copying & ChatGPT are encouraged.</strong></summary>

You _CAN_ copy from friends and LLMs. You can work in groups. You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...

You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final in-person end-term exam).

- **Why copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.
- **To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.
- **To learn better, share** what you've learnt. Learn from others' feedback.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Check system requirements.</strong></summary>

Check [system-requirements.md](system-requirements.md) for permissions you need, software to install, and websites to access. You may need to speak with your system administrator for access.

Updates:

- **23 Sep 2025**: We swapped modules 2 & 3. Deployment Tools is now _before_ AI coding - because the AI coding graded assignment needs deployment. Dates revised:
  - GA2 release is on 24 Sep (was 18 Sep).
  - GA3 release is on 1 Oct (was 25 Sep)

### Notes

- **[Graded Assignment 1][GA1] checks course pre-requisites**. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.
- **We may post bonus activities on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)
- **LLMs will evaluate you**. Results vary each run. Learn to answer them _robustly_. LLM decisions are **final**.
