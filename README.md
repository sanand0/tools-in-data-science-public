# Tools in Data Science - May 2025

[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches
popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.

<details>
<summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary>

Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.

But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?

These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:

- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.
- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.
- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.

[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) "We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself."](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)

In this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.

Learn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.

<summary><strong>This course is quite hard</strong></summary>

Here's students' feedback:

- [2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268)
- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.

**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-05-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.

<summary><strong>But it's probably worth it.</strong></summary>

Here's students' feedback:

- [Course experience and farewell post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/course-experience-and-farewell-post/173247)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Programming skills are a pre-requisite</strong></summary>

You need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.

**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.

In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.

This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>If you passed, don't enroll again</strong></summary>

The course is public, so you can always audit it.

Also, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625).

</details>

<summary><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></summary>

You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).

**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.

**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.

**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.

### Notes

- **[Graded Assignment 1][GA1] checks course pre-requisites**. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.
- **Remote exams are open and hard**
  - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...
  - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)
- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy.
- **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.
- **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)
- **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.
  - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks.
