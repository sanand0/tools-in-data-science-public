## What is version control?

**Version control** is a system that tracks changes to files over time.
It lets you see history, compare versions, and go back if needed.

Think of it as a time machine for your project.

---

## Why version control is needed

- **Undo mistakes** by rolling back to a previous version.
- **Track changes** to see what changed and when.
- **Collaborate** without overwriting each other.
- **Experiment safely** on a branch without breaking main work.
- **Keep a backup** of your project history.

## How Git helps

**Git** is the most common version control tool.
It helps by giving you:

- **Commits**: saved snapshots of your work with a message.
- **History**: a timeline of changes you can inspect or return to.
- **Diffs**: a clear view of what changed between versions.
- **Branches**: separate lines of work you can merge later.
- **Remotes**: shared copies (like GitHub) for backup and teamwork.

Git is **distributed**, which means every clone has the full history.

## Simple workflow (conceptual)

1. Edit files.
2. Stage the changes you want to keep.
3. Commit a snapshot with a message.
4. Push to a remote to share or back up.

## Diagrams (draw.io / diagrams.net)

Open this `.drawio` file in draw.io / diagrams.net (File -> Open From -> Device):

- `bridging/git-workflow.drawio`
