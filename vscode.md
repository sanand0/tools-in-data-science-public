## Editor: VS Code

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal. That's where you'll spend most of your time. Make sure you're comfortable with it.

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is, _by far_, the most popular code editor today. According to the [2024 StackOverflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#1-integrated-development-environment) almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you'll be working with others who use it, and it's a good idea to have some exposure.
