Carefully examine the structure of the repo and understand how its organised and what the content covers.

Create a series of prompts that will be used by the AI to generate bridging materials for new users.
The new set of materials will act as a bridging resource for users who are new to the repo's subject matter.

The prompts should guide the AI to produce content that is clear, concise, and easy to understand for beginners.
The prompts should be output into a markdown file named `./prompts/bridging-material.md`
