# Project: Data Analyst Agent

Deploy a data analyst agent. This is an API that uses LLMs to source, prepare, analyze, and visualize any data.

Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.

The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a data analysis task description and optional attachments in the body. For example:

```bash
curl "https://app.example.com/api/" -F "questions.txt=@question.txt" -F "image.png=@image.png" -F "data.csv=@data.csv"
```

`questions.txt` will ALWAYS be sent and contain the questions. There may be zero or more additional files passed.

The answers must be sent within 3 minutes in the format requested.

> [!WARNING] > \*\*These are not the final questions you'll be evaluated on. These examples are indicative.

## Sample questions

These are _examples_ of `questions.txt` that will be sent. **NOT** the actual question, which will be a secret.

```markdown
Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.

1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.
   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."` under 100,000 bytes.
```

Here's another example.

The Indian high court judgement dataset contains judgements from the Indian High Courts, downloaded from [ecourts website](https://judgments.ecourts.gov.in/). It contains judgments of 25 high courts, along with raw metadata (as .json) and structured metadata (as .parquet).

- 25 high courts
- ~16M judgments
- ~1TB of data

Structure of the data in the bucket:

- `data/pdf/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/judgment1.pdf,judgment2.pdf`
- `metadata/json/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/judgment1.json,judgment2.json`
- `metadata/parquet/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/metadata.parquet`
- `metadata/tar/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/metadata.tar.gz`
- `data/tar/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/pdfs.tar`

This DuckDB query counts the number of decisions in the dataset.

```sql
INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;
INSTALL parquet; LOAD parquet;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('s3://indian-high-court-judgments/metadata/parquet/year=*/court=*/bench=*/metadata.parquet?s3_region=ap-south-1');
```

Here are the columns in the data:

| Column                 | Type    | Description                    |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `court_code`           | VARCHAR | Court identifier (e.g., 33~10) |
| `title`                | VARCHAR | Case title and parties         |
| `description`          | VARCHAR | Case description               |
| `judge`                | VARCHAR | Presiding judge(s)             |
| `pdf_link`             | VARCHAR | Link to judgment PDF           |
| `cnr`                  | VARCHAR | Case Number Register           |
| `date_of_registration` | VARCHAR | Registration date              |
| `decision_date`        | DATE    | Date of judgment               |
| `disposal_nature`      | VARCHAR | Case outcome                   |
| `court`                | VARCHAR | Court name                     |
| `raw_html`             | VARCHAR | Original HTML content          |
| `bench`                | VARCHAR | Bench identifier               |
| `year`                 | BIGINT  | Year partition                 |

Here is a sample row:

```json
{
  "court_code": "33~10",
  "title": "CRL MP(MD)/4399/2023 of Vinoth Vs The Inspector of Police",
  "description": "No.4399 of 2023 BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT ( Criminal Jurisdiction ) Thursday, ...",
  "judge": "HONOURABLE  MR JUSTICE G.K. ILANTHIRAIYAN",
  "pdf_link": "court/cnrorders/mdubench/orders/HCMD010287762023_1_2023-03-16.pdf",

  "court": "33_10",
  "raw_html": "<button type='button' role='link'..",
  "bench": "mdubench",
  "year": 2023
}
```

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON object containing the answer.

```json
{
  "Which high court disposed the most cases from 2019 - 2022?": "...",
  "What's the regression slope of the date_of_registration - decision_date by year in the court=33_10?": "...",
  "Plot the year and # of days of delay from the above question as a scatterplot with a regression line. Encode as a base64 data URI under 100,000 characters": "data:image/webp:base64,..."
}
```

## Evaluation

Here is a sample evaluation to the first question. This is **indicative**. The real evaluation will depend on the actual question, which will be a secret.

Your score will be the score provided by promptfoo. No normalization. What you get is what you get.

## Deploy your application

Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform.

(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)

## Share your code

- [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
- [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)
- Commit and push your code

## Submit your URL

### Submission and Testing Process

1. **GitHub Accessibility Check**  
   - When you submit your endpoint and GitHub repository, the system first checks if your GitHub repo is **publicly accessible**.  
   - The repository must be **unique**.

2. **MIT License Check**  
   - The system verifies that your repository contains an **MIT LICENSE** file.

3. **API Testing Setup**  
   - Three simultaneous requests are sent to your API endpoint.  
   - Each request corresponds to a **separate public test case**, each with its own `questions.txt` file.

4. **Retries and Timeout Rules**  
   - Each request can retry up to **4 times**.  
   - Each attempt has a **5-minute timeout**.  
   - Your API must respond **within 5 minutes** per request.  
   - If your API does not respond in time, you **will not be scored** for all the questions in that test case.  
   - **Tip:** Always return something in the correct JSON structure within the time limit, even if the answers are wrong — you can still get partial marks.

5. **Multiple Questions per Request**  
   - A single `curl` request may contain **multiple questions** from the attached `questions.txt`.  
   - The **5-minute timeout applies to the entire request**, not each question.

6. **Scoring for Public Test Cases**  
   - You are graded on how many questions are correct.  
   - If a request fails after 4 retries, you lose **all marks for that test case**.  
   - You can still earn marks if the **other requests succeed**.

7. **Resubmission Rules**  
   - During testing, you cannot submit another request (the form will be disabled).  
   - After tests complete, you can download the test output.
   - You may then submit another test if desired (note: each test uses up your AI credits).

8. **Final Scoring**  
   - Marks come from **private test cases** evaluated **after the deadline**.  
   - Public test cases are for **debugging purposes only** — no marks are awarded for them.

Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at our custom [Project 2 submission portal](http://34.100.231.127:8000/).
