# Project: Data Analyst Agent

> [!WARNING] > **THIS IS A DRAFT**

Deploy a data analyst agent. This is an API that uses LLMs to source, prepare, analyze, and visualize any data.

Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.

The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a data analysis task description in the body. For example:

```bash
curl "https://app.example.com/api/" -F "@question.txt"
```

The answers must be sent within 3 minutes in the format requested.

## Sample questions

These are _examples_ of `quesions.txt` that will be sent. **NOT** the actual question, which will be a secret.

```markdown
Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.

1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.
   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."` under 100,000 bytes.
```

Here's another example.

The Indian high court judgement dataset contains judgements from the Indian High Courts, downloaded from [ecourts website](https://judgments.ecourts.gov.in/). It contains judgments of 25 high courts, along with raw metadata (as .json) and structured metadata (as .parquet).

- 25 high courts
- ~16M judgments
- ~1TB of data

Structure of the data in the bucket:

- `data/pdf/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/judgment1.pdf,judgment2.pdf`
- `metadata/json/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/judgment1.json,judgment2.json`
- `metadata/parquet/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/metadata.parquet`
- `metadata/tar/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/metadata.tar.gz`
- `data/tar/year=2025/court=xyz/bench=xyz/pdfs.tar`

This DuckDB query counts the number of decisions in the dataset.

```sql
INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;
INSTALL parquet; LOAD parquet;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('s3://indian-high-court-judgments/metadata/parquet/year=*/court=*/bench=*/metadata.parquet?s3_region=ap-south-1');
```

Here are the columns in the data:

| Column                 | Type    | Description                    |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `court_code`           | VARCHAR | Court identifier (e.g., 33~10) |
| `title`                | VARCHAR | Case title and parties         |
| `description`          | VARCHAR | Case description               |
| `judge`                | VARCHAR | Presiding judge(s)             |
| `pdf_link`             | VARCHAR | Link to judgment PDF           |
| `cnr`                  | VARCHAR | Case Number Register           |
| `date_of_registration` | VARCHAR | Registration date              |
| `decision_date`        | DATE    | Date of judgment               |
| `disposal_nature`      | VARCHAR | Case outcome                   |
| `court`                | VARCHAR | Court name                     |
| `raw_html`             | VARCHAR | Original HTML content          |
| `bench`                | VARCHAR | Bench identifier               |
| `year`                 | BIGINT  | Year partition                 |

Here is a sample row:

```json
{
  "court_code": "33~10",
  "title": "CRL MP(MD)/4399/2023 of Vinoth Vs The Inspector of Police",
  "description": "No.4399 of 2023 BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT ( Criminal Jurisdiction ) Thursday, ...",
  "judge": "HONOURABLE  MR JUSTICE G.K. ILANTHIRAIYAN",
  "pdf_link": "court/cnrorders/mdubench/orders/HCMD010287762023_1_2023-03-16.pdf",

```

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON object containing the answer.

```json
{
  "Which high court disposed the most cases from 2019 - 2022?": "...",
  "What's the regression slope of the date_of_registration - decision_date by year in the court=33_10?": "...",
  "Plot the year and # of days of delay from the above question as a scatterplot with a regression line. Encode as a base64 data URI under 100,000 characters": "data:image/webp:base64,..."

Your score will be the score provided by promptfoo. No normalization. What you get is what you get.
