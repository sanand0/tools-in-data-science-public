## T - Score Calculation

The final score for the course is calculated as follows:
| Components (All out of 100)              | Weight  |
|------------------------------------------|---------|
| Grade Assessments **(GA)** <br> Best 5/8 | 20%     |
| Project 1 **(P1)**                       | 20%     |
| Project 2 **(P2)**                       | 20%     |
| Remote Online Exam **(ROE)**             | 20%     |
| End Term **(ET)**                        | 20%     |

#### End Term Eligibility: Best 4/5 first GAs Average >= 40

T = 0.2 GA + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.2 ROE + 0.2 ET

> Note: The scores are updated one to two days after the deadline for the GAs and ROEs. Score updates for Projects can take more than a week or two due to large evaluation time frames.
