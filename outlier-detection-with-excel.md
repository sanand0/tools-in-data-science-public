You'll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:

- **Understanding Outliers**: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.
- **Calculating Quartiles**: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
- **Determining Bounds**: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.
- **Identifying Outliers**: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.
- **Visualizing Data**: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.
- **Handling Outliers**: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.
