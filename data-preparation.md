# Data Preparation

Data preparation is crucial because raw data is rarely perfect.

It often contains errors, inconsistencies, or missing values. For example, marks data may have 'NA' or 'absent' for non-attendees, which you need to handle.

This section teaches you how to clean up data, convert it to different formats, aggregate it if required, and get a feel for the data before you analyze.
