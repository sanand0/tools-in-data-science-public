# Data Visualization with ChatGPT

ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) can help create compelling data visualizations by:

1. Finding and analyzing datasets
2. Generating visualization code
3. Improving visual design
4. Creating data stories

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (free) - good for processing images and video
- A [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) Plus subscription ($20/month) - recommended for access to advanced models and coding capabilities
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/) - for publishing visualizations
- Basic familiarity with HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Other useful but optional tools include:

- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) ($17/month) - particularly good at front-end code
- Command line tools:
  - [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

## Finding Datasets

When asking ChatGPT to recommend datasets, provide clear requirements:

1. Size constraints (e.g., "around 10,000-100,000 rows")
2. Desired column types (text, numbers, categories)
3. Target audience and story potential
4. Any specific themes or domains of interest

Example prompt:

```
I need an interesting dataset for data visualization that:
- Has 10,000-100,000 rows
- Includes various column types (text, numbers, categories)
- Could tell an engaging story for a general audience
- Ideally covers [your preferred theme/domain]

Please search online and suggest datasets matching these criteria.
```

## Ideating Stories

Once you have a dataset, ask ChatGPT to suggest story ideas:

```
Given these columns in my dataset:
[List your columns]

Please suggest:
1. A dozen potential data stories
2. Target audience for each story
3. Why each story would be interesting
4. Initial approach for analysis
```

## Analysis and Visualization

For the analysis phase, instruct ChatGPT to:

1. Run statistical tests
2. Filter out insignificant results
3. Create aesthetically pleasing visualizations
4. Consider outlier handling

Example prompt:

```
Please analyze this dataset by:
1. Running relevant statistical tests
2. Removing statistically insignificant results
3. Creating beautiful visualizations (consider styling, colors, typography)
4. Handling outliers appropriately
5. Ensuring the visualization tells a clear story
```

## Generating Web-Ready Code

When creating visualizations for web deployment, provide specific constraints:

```
Please create an HTML/JavaScript visualization that:
1. Works well on GitHub Pages
2. Keeps the data payload under 2MB
3. Handles outliers appropriately
4. Uses modern JavaScript
5. Follows good web performance practices
```

## Improving Visual Design

To enhance the visualization's appearance, ask for specific improvements:

```
Please improve this visualization by:
1. Using a professional typography system
2. Implementing an appropriate color scheme
3. Adding proper spacing and layout
4. Including clear annotations and context
5. Making it feel like a professional publication (e.g., New York Times style)
```

## Example Projects

Here are some examples of data visualizations created using this approach:

1. [Books Visualization](https://sanand0.github.io/booksviz/)
2. [Books Analysis](https://rasagy.in/books-viz/)
3. [LLM Data Visualization](https://rishabhmakes.github.io/llm-dataviz/)
4. [Books Visual Story](https://devanshikat.github.io/BooksVis/)
5. [Books Data Exploration](https://nchandrasekharr.github.io/booksviz/)
6. [Coffee Reviews](http://coffee-reviews.prayashm.com/)
7. [Story Visualization](https://story-b0f1c.web.app/)

## Best Practices

1. **Iterate with the LLM**: Don't expect perfect results on the first try. Refine your prompts based on the outputs.

2. **Be Specific**: Clearly specify your requirements for:

   - Visual style
   - Performance constraints
   - Target audience
   - Story elements

3. **Data Size**: Consider GitHub Pages limitations when deploying. Either:

   - Preprocess data to reduce size
   - Use data sampling techniques
   - Implement progressive loading

4. **Code Quality**: Request modern, maintainable code:

   - Use ES modules
   - Implement responsive design
   - Follow web accessibility guidelines
   - Include error handling

5. **Documentation**: Ask the LLM to include:
   - Clear code comments
   - Setup instructions
   - Data preprocessing steps
   - Deployment guide
