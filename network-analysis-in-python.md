## Network Analysis in Python

[![Talk: Exploring the Movie Actor Network in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/uPL3VuRqOy4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/uPL3VuRqOy4)

You'll learn how to use network analysis to identify clusters and connections between nodes in a dataset, covering:

- **Network Construction**: Build a network from the IMDb database, where nodes represent actors and edges represent shared movie appearances.
- **Clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to detect communities within the network, using the scikit-network library.
- **Matrix Operations**: Utilize matrix operations to efficiently analyze actor relationships and interactions.
- **Community Detection**: Implement algorithms to identify and interpret clusters, examining how different actor clusters are connected.
- **Application of Findings**: Explore practical applications of network analysis, such as social network analysis and its potential uses in various domains.
