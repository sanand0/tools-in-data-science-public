Duration: 2h 52m

Here's an FAQ based on the provided transcript, summarizing student questions and instructor answers in a conversational style:

**Q1: Where can I find the recorded video sessions for Tools in Data Science (TDS)? I've checked the C Portal and couldn't find them.**

**A1:** The entire course content, including recorded videos, is not hosted on the C Portal. Instead, it's available on a separate site. The C Portal usually provides a link to this external site. All content will be available only via this specific site.

**Q2: Will the recording of _this_ session be available on YouTube?**

**A2:** Yes, this session's recording will be available on YouTube, usually within about a day.

**Q3: Why isn't the content for this course on the C Portal like other subjects?**

**A3:** Most subjects have fairly static course content, but for TDS, roughly 20% or more of the content changes every term because it's a rapidly evolving field. We need a dynamic solution that allows us to quickly update content, which the C Portal doesn't easily facilitate. By hosting it on our own cloud provider, we can iterate quickly and rectify issues faster. This also makes all past course content publicly available via a GitHub repo, offering you more granular access than the C Portal. Additionally, assignments in TDS are parameterized by your email, generating unique datasets for each student, which is cumbersome to achieve on the C Portal.

**Q4: Where will graded assignments be released, and how do I access them?**

**A4:** Graded assignments will first appear on _our_ main course website. We will also provide a link from the C Portal, but the primary place to find them will be our site as soon as they are released.

**Q5: What's the difference between the "Check" button and the "Save" button on the assignment portal?**

**A5:** The "Check" button gives you instant feedback on whether your answer is correct. It doesn't save your progress. To actually save your answers, you must click the "Save" button, which is available at the top and bottom of the page. If you don't save, your answers won't be recorded, even if they show as 10/10 from checking.

**Q6: How do I know if my answers have been successfully saved on your server?**

**A6:** When you hit "Save," look at the top of the page. It will show a "Recent Saves" section. If your submission doesn't appear there, it means we haven't received your score. Always confirm you see an entry there after saving.

**Q7: Can I submit my assignments multiple times? Which submission will count?**

**A7:** Yes, you can submit multiple times. However, only your _most recent_ submission is considered the official score. So, even if you had a perfect score previously, your last submission, whatever its score, is what counts. This policy is consistent across all subjects in the program.

**Q8: I'm a direct diploma student from a non-programming background (e.g., civil/mechanical engineering), and I don't have much coding experience. Will this course accommodate students like me, especially with advanced topics like Mad 1 and Mad 2 prerequisites?**

**A8:** This is a common question. We understand some students may lack prior programming experience. That's why Machine Learning Practice (MLP) is a corequisite for TDS – to ensure you gain some foundational Python and library usage skills before starting this course. We've raised this concern with operations regarding admission messaging. We will provide as much support as possible, but if you lack prerequisite skills, you will likely need to dedicate more time to the course. It is doable, but expect to spend double the time compared to someone with prior experience.

**Q9: What are the specific programming skills or concepts I should focus on to succeed in TDS? Are there any short courses you recommend for API and deployment?**

**A9:** Our course website clearly outlines the expected knowledge by module. We've curated high-quality external videos and starter code directly within the course content to save you time.
The most crucial foundational tools are covered in Module 1, including:

- Using UV and NPX.
- Browser developer tools.
- Understanding JSON.
- Terminal commands.
- Basic SQL queries.
- Git and GitHub.
  These will be used constantly throughout the course.

The two most challenging and crucial concepts, which strongly correlate with student performance, are **APIs** (specifically REST APIs and how to build server-side APIs) and **deployment** (how to deploy your solutions to the cloud for public access). If you master these two, you will excel. Think of APIs as the "plumbing" connecting different parts of a system.

We don't specifically recommend external short courses because our internal course material, including curated videos and starter code, is designed to be comprehensive and sufficient. If you encounter difficulties, we'll address them in live sessions. Don't underestimate the starter code and provided resources; they are carefully selected to maximize your learning efficiently.

**Q10: Are there exams, projects, or other assessments, and what is their weightage?**

**A10:** Yes, there are two projects, which are group projects (though individual submission of your unique code is required). We encourage collaboration as it mimics real-world scenarios and fosters faster learning. The course is open book/open internet, allowing you to use any resource, including AI tools like GPT, friends, or expert developers, as long as you produce the final result. All assessments have a 20% weightage: Project 1, Project 2, Remote Online Exam, Final Term Exam, and Graded Assignments.

**Q11: Will the projects be the same as previous terms, and will they become harder?**

**A11:** Projects change every term and typically become harder. This is because AI tools like GPT are constantly improving, so we need to challenge you to think at a _systems level_, which GPTs haven't yet mastered. Our goal is to make you job-ready. Mastering this course alone can make you highly employable. If you only aim for a good grade without focusing on deep learning, you're doing yourself a disservice.

**Q12: Is there a specific tool or framework for creating AI agents (like N8N for workflow automation)?**

**A12:** Yes, you will be creating AI agents and connecting data pipelines. We primarily provide access to OpenAI's GPT models via an AI pipe token. You can use any provider, but we give you an OpenAI key that allows you to experiment with it. We don't typically focus on tools like N8N directly in the course content because they might not be industry-standard yet and are still evolving. However, our TAs might demonstrate such approaches. We will teach you the underlying concepts of constructing robust agents and connecting different components, giving you the skills to adapt to various tools.

**Q13: I'm concerned about how challenging the projects will be. Will the TAs provide significant support?**

**A13:** We select our TAs rigorously, ensuring they have the patience and deep knowledge to guide students through potentially basic and technical concepts. Our goal is not for students to fail, but to provide the best possible support within our time constraints. We have three dedicated TAs for this subject, along with the instructor, offering multiple viewpoints and comprehensive assistance. We've invested more resources to help you succeed, as some students naturally require more support.

**Q14: What about the end-term exam?**

**A14:** There is an end-term exam, but it is administered separately at the test center. All other assessments (assignments, projects, remote online exams) are handled through our custom portal.

**Q15: How much time will we have for projects?**

**A15:** We give you plenty of time. For instance, Project 1 was released on September 20th and is due on October 20th, giving you approximately a month. You also get a preview of the project beforehand.

**Q16: Can I use my existing Ubuntu 22.04 WSL setup, or do I need to update it?**

**A16:** If you already have an Ubuntu 22.04 WSL setup, that's fine; you don't need to update it.

**Q17: If I use a Linux system directly, is there anything specific I need to do for this course?**

**A17:** If you're using Linux directly, you don't need WSL. You'll install Ubuntu, and we'll cover basic Linux commands. We recommend learning some fundamental Linux commands beforehand.

**Q18: What if I prefer to use Oracle VirtualBox for my Linux environment instead of WSL?**

**A18:** Oracle VirtualBox is also acceptable. Any Linux distribution works. While WSL is generally easier, especially on Windows 11, VirtualBox is fine. You can even dual-boot if you prefer.

**Q19: Can I complete this course entirely on a Linux system?**

**A19:** Yes, you can complete the entire course using a Linux system.

**Q20: Can I use drag-and-drop functionality for files in WSL, similar to a VM?**

**A20:** Yes, with WSL, you can use your Windows File Explorer to drag and drop files directly into your Linux environment, which is typically more convenient than what some VMs offer.

**Q21: You mentioned a token for OpenAI. Is that provided, and can I use it from now on?**

**A21:** Yes, we provide an OpenAI token via an AI Pipe login. You sign in with your email on our platform (aipipe.org/login), get the token, and can use it immediately. It comes with a $1 per week allowance. If you prefer, you can also use free providers like Gemini.

**Q22: Is it possible to install Ubuntu WSL on a drive other than C:?**

**A22:** Yes, it is possible, but it's a bit more complex. Microsoft's website provides instructions on how to change the default installation location for WSL distributions. You'll need to modify some configurations, but it can be done.

**Q23: I noticed that module 1 and module 2 submissions are due on the same date. Will this be challenging?**

**A23:** Module 1 and 2 submissions are indeed due on the same date, October 5th. However, today is September 20th, so you have plenty of time. Module 1 should take no more than a week to complete, and Module 2 will be released soon.

**Q24: What does "LTS" stand for in the context of Ubuntu versions?**

**A24:** LTS stands for "Long Term Support." Ubuntu releases new versions every year, but LTS versions are the final, stable releases that receive extended support, making them preferable for stability.

**Q25: What should I do after installing Ubuntu WSL?**

**A25:** After installing Ubuntu, your first step is to update WSL by running `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` in PowerShell. This ensures all packages are up-to-date, which is crucial for subsequent installations and functionalities.

**Q26: I'm seeing a problem with automatic answers appearing in the GA portal on certain browsers. Is this something that can be fixed?**

**A26:** Yes, your observation aligns with some known issues. We'll discuss this with Professor Anand. Regarding "hacking," while we don't penalize you for finding alternative ways to get answers, we do log all activity. Just because you successfully "hack" it doesn't mean we're unaware. We encourage you to engage in such problem-solving, but we also want you to understand the underlying concepts. For instance, in the toughest exam (ROE), despite allowing all resources, some students still struggled, showing that deep understanding is key. We actively track how students approach challenges to improve our course.

**Q27: What are these release dates mentioned next to each module/content, like "24.04"?**

**A27:** These dates, such as 24.04, refer to the GA (General Availability) release dates of the specific content or module version. These versions are fixed, so once installed, they won't automatically update. It's a snapshot in time.

**Q28: Will the tools used for time-stamping video lectures (to jump to specific topics) be publicly available?**

**A28:** Yes, we developed an AI tool internally to time-stamp our video lectures, allowing you to jump directly to specific topics. We'll be making that tool publicly available on GitHub. This saves you time by avoiding the need to watch entire videos for specific information.

**Q29: Can you explain the difference between the YouTube playlist and the content on the main course website?**

**A29:** The YouTube playlist primarily contains recordings from _past_ terms. The main course website (TDS.s-anand.net) hosts all current course content, including curated videos, lecture notes, and assignments. To get the most up-to-date and curated information, you should focus on the main course website.

**Q30: I'm worried about my background (e.g., Mechanical Engineering) and my lack of programming knowledge. How can I best prepare for this course, especially with advanced topics like AI agents?**

**A30:** It's understandable to feel apprehensive. The instructor and TAs are here to help you bridge that gap. We'll cover all the necessary basics, from command-line tools to API development. Our approach is hands-on, with live sessions demonstrating concepts. We encourage you to utilize all available resources, including our comprehensive course content and the Discord community, for support. The key is active engagement and not hesitating to ask questions. While we won't deep-dive into every tool like N8N, we'll teach you the foundational principles that apply broadly to AI agent development and data pipeline construction.

**Q31: Will there be official groups or forums for student collaboration?**

**A31:** While there are no official pre-assigned groups, we highly encourage student-formed groups and actively promote interaction on our Discord server. Discord is a critical platform for quick help and peer learning. We monitor it closely, and faculty often participate, demonstrating our commitment to supporting you. It’s a space where you can ask questions, share insights, and get real-time assistance.

**Q32: Is it possible to see the names of people who have successfully "hacked" the exam?**

**A32:** Due to data privacy concerns, we cannot disclose the names of students who achieved full marks, even if through unconventional methods like "hacking." However, we do internally track and analyze these approaches to learn and improve the course design.

**Q33: Will we be learning about tools like N8N for workflow automation and AI agents?**

**A33:** We provide the fundamental concepts for building AI agents and workflows. While we don't specifically focus on N8N, we aim to teach you the underlying principles so you can adapt to various tools. The TAs might demonstrate certain tools as possible approaches.

**Q34: How are the graded assignments structured, especially regarding the underlying code?**

**A34:** The graded assignments include starter code and related content directly embedded with the questions. Our data indicates that many students often skip the content and jump straight to answering. To ensure learning, if you get stuck, the relevant content is conveniently placed right above the question. This allows you to learn as you go.

**Q35: What's the process for getting the OpenAI API token, and is it free?**

**A35:** We provide an OpenAI token through an AI Pipe login. You can get an allowance, which is free ($1/week) for experimentation. We offer instructions on how to sign up for this service. You can also use other free providers like Gemini if you prefer.

**Q36: Is WSL 11 required, or can I use WSL 10 for the course?**

**A36:** WSL 11 is not strictly required. WSL 10 is perfectly fine for this course.

**Q37: What about the syllabus or roadmap for the course? Where can I find that?**
