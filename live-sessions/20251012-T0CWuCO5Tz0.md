Duration: 1h 0m

Here's an FAQ summary of the TDS live tutorial:

**Q1: What is the purpose of this session?**

**A1:** This is a doubt-clearing and query session, not a learning session. Feel free to ask any questions related to grievances, specific General Assignments (GAs), or operational issues.

**Q2: I'm having trouble accessing GA3 and GA4. Are they available, and how can I get the links?**

**A2:** Yes, GA3 and GA4 are officially available. I've already shared the links on Discourse, and I'm sharing them again in the chat. Please check there.

**Q3: For Project 1, do I need to use search tools to fetch real-time data, or is just using the LLM API sufficient?**

**A3:** The LLM API should be sufficient for the task. The prompts provided are designed to cover the entirety of the task. However, the evaluation might include fetching data. We also have a "fetch tool" to get data from specific attachments or static websites, but we're not looking for complex web scraping.

**Q4: The project page includes a CAPTCHA solver. Is this just an example, or will we be expected to build one that works on static GitHub Pages, which seems challenging with just an LLM prompt?**

**A4:** Building a CAPTCHA solver is indeed possible, even for a static website. While it might not be easily achievable, it's not impossible. We've successfully implemented one ourselves. If you encounter specific implementation issues, please raise them on Discourse with details. You'll generally be expected to resolve CAPTCHAs, but not necessarily with 100% accuracy, and we're not asking for overly complex scenarios.

**Q5: When deploying my application to GitHub Pages for Project 1, the URL is returned immediately, but the page isn't active for a few seconds. How will the evaluation script handle this? Should I add a "sleep" function to my code?**

**A5:** You do not need to add a "sleep" function within your application code. For evaluation, we allow a 10-minute window for the application to become active. If we don't receive a request from your application within that time, it's considered not active. Our evaluation process happens after all submissions are complete (by October 17th for Project 1), not immediately after your deployment. We ensure our evaluation system waits for an HTTP 200 response, and you can implement similar logic for your own testing with a validation function that pings the application a few times.

**Q6: Is the GitHub API for Project 1 synchronous or asynchronous?**

**A6:** I believe it's an asynchronous (async) mode. I'll confirm this and post an update later.

**Q7: I've deployed my Project 1 solution on HuggingFace Spaces. Do I need to send my JSON response to a specific "evaluation URL" provided by the IITM team? Also, should I immediately return a 200 status code, or wait 10 minutes before sending the full response?**

**A7:** Yes, you need to call the "evaluation URL" and send your JSON response there. And yes, you should wait for 10 minutes before sending the full response. For testing your application, you can use the evaluation samples provided in the project page as a guide for how we'll test it. Please share your official URL and any specific issues on Discourse, including screenshots, so we can assist. Simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe or a calculator are good examples for testing.

**Q8: What kind of tasks can we expect for Project 1? Will they be as basic as building a calculator, or more complex?**

**A8:** The tasks will be basic, not overly complex. We've tested with simple games like Snake and Ladder or Chess. The prompt brief we provide will be detailed enough for your LLM to generate good code. We also had a session on iterative prompt engineering to help you optimize your prompts, which should be available in the playlist.

**Q9: What's the expected time commitment for Project 1? Should I finish all the weekly assignments first before starting it?**

**A9:** There's no fixed timeline as the time commitment varies significantly based on individual skill sets and familiarity with the concepts. I recommend starting Project 1 immediately. This will help you understand what's required and identify any skill gaps early. If you're familiar with all concepts, it might take less than two days. If new, expect hiccups. It's not just about coding but also integrating different components like GitHub Pages, HuggingFace, and Docker.

You can work on weekly assignments and Project 1 in parallel. You have the freedom to manage your time and choose your workflow. The key is to start early, identify issues, and use Discourse to ask for help. We also provide hands-on sessions and recordings for building projects from scratch.

**Q10: My graded assignments are showing zero marks, even though I submitted them and the system confirmed saving. What should I do?**

**A10:** I see some scores for GA1 (e.g., 4.39 and 2.69). Please send screenshots of what you're seeing on your portal and the Looker dashboard to my email (which I'm sharing in the chat) so I can investigate further.

**Q11: How do I access the Gemini API with my personal email? It's showing as restricted.**

**A11:** You should be able to access the Gemini API with your personal email. While there might be restrictions with an IITM organizational email, personal emails typically work. Please re-verify and let me know the exact error message or challenge you're encountering. We've extensively tested this, and it generally functions correctly.

**Q12: Is there a possibility of a deadline extension for GA4 and Project 1?**

**A12:** We always ensure sufficient time for submissions. If there's a delay from our end (e.g., GA release delayed), the deadline will be pushed accordingly. We also consider other operational issues or challenges that might arise. If an extension is needed, we'll discuss it internally, but any decision would depend on how critical the reason is and typically requires verification with multiple teams.

**Q13: Why is my course admin email (like 22P1SC2002) used for communication?**

**A13:** That ID is basically the course admin email. All your emails and notifications for this TDS course come from that specific ID.

**Q14: For the CAPTCHA solver, I'm getting an "undefined incorrect" error. What's wrong?**

**A14:** Please share screenshots of the error on Discourse. Also, try modifying your prompt. Instead of a random image, perhaps use an image with a simple, listed word (e.g., a five-letter word). See if the CAPTCHA solver can correctly process and return that. This might help in debugging the exact issue.

**Q15: What's your name, sir?**

**A15:** My name is Prasanna.
