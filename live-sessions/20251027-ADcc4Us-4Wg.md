Duration: 1h 20m

## Part 1

Here's an FAQ summary of the first part of the tutorial:

**Q1: How do I test the deployment of my project?**

**A1:** You can test it on the existing public test cases. The project page includes checks, so try to see if your deployment passes those tests.

**Q2: The test cases are in YAML format. Do I need to convert them to JSON?**

**A2:** Yes, the requests will be coming through JSON, so you'll need to convert your YAML test cases to JSON before passing them.

**Q3: The previous session mentioned sending an immediate 200 HTTP response. My system takes 1-2 minutes to process the request. Is that acceptable?**

**A3:** You should send the 200 HTTP response immediately after verifying the secret key. Once you've matched the secret key (ensuring the request is from a trusted source), send the 200 response. All the heavy processing, like interacting with LLMs, creating GitHub repos, and enabling GitHub pages, can happen afterwards.

**Q4: So, the immediate 200 HTTP status is only required after checking the secret key?**

**A4:** Yes, precisely. As soon as you verify the secret key, send that 200 response.

**Q5: My deployment is producing a good amount of tasks, but how can I build advanced checks or evaluation scripts for them?**

**A5:** You can use LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude AI to write evaluation scripts. You can ask them to generate better or different test cases and scenarios for your project.

**Q6: What about the nonces? Will they be the same for multiple rounds of the same task, like round one and round two?**

**A6:** No, nonces are one-time use tokens. They will be different for each round. A nonce helps us verify that a request is from the specific user we initiated contact with and that it hasn't been reused. The secret key is for you to verify the source, while the nonce is for us to verify the specific request.

**Q7: If I send two round one requests from the same machine, will the nonces clash? How do I handle evaluation for different rounds in my temporary database?**

**A7:** You should match requests based on a unique **task ID**. Each task will have a unique ID, allowing you to track and manage different rounds without conflicts.

**Q8: How will I know what nonces you (the server) are sending me?**

**A8:** Both the secret key and the nonce will be included in the JSON object that we send to your server. If your server can access the secret variable in the JSON, it will also be able to access the nonce variable from the same JSON object.

**Q9: How will you (the server) verify the nonces and other data? Do I need to send the nonce back to the evaluation URL?**

**A9:** Yes, you need to send the nonce, along with other relevant data, back to the evaluation URL. That's how we verify that the response is from a request _we_ sent and that it's a valid, unique response.

**Q10: My project's deadline is showing incorrectly as tomorrow morning 11:29 AM. I mentioned this yesterday. Why is it still wrong?**

**A10:** Please share your entire screen, not just a single tab, so I can see your system's time and how it's displaying the deadline. I will take your email address and investigate the issue. If needed, we might ask you to join a separate meeting to diagnose the problem.

**Q11: I've created some demo tasks on the GitHub page for my project. Is that all I need to do, or is there more?**

**A11:** Please check the project one page documentation. Your endpoint should correctly accept incoming requests, send an immediate 200 HTTP response after checking the secret, and then ping our evaluation server. Ensure your code implements this full flow.

**Q12: I created my demo task with the help of ChatGPT. Is that acceptable?**

**A12:** Yes, it's fine that you used ChatGPT to generate the code. The main thing is to ensure your code handles the request flow correctly as described in A11.

**Q13: I'm having trouble with Hugging Face; I can't create an account with either my personal or IITM ID.**

**A13:** We can discuss this issue later.

**Q14: Can there be a dummy evaluation server from the IITM side so we can test our projects and see where our test cases are failing?**

**A14:** We will think about this request. I cannot promise anything at this time. This would indeed be helpful for debugging prompts and LLM integration. We will discuss it with the internal team and provide an update on Discourse.

**Q15: I'm just starting Project 1, and the documentation is hard to understand. Can you simplify the whole project process and provide a timeline?**

**A15:** The project details were explained thoroughly in the session held on October 4th. That session is available on YouTube. Please watch it for a comprehensive understanding of Project 1, including how to use LLMs with APIs. The deadline for Project 1 is October 17th.

**Q16: I'm using Copilot on VS Code, but it says my license has expired or I've exceeded a limit, even though I've barely used it. What should I do?**

**A16:** GitHub Copilot generally allows 50 questions per month. It's possible you or someone else unintentionally used up your quota. If you have the GitHub Education Pack, you can use that. Otherwise, you might need to find an alternative way to get code snippets for now, perhaps by asking someone for help and then modifying the code yourself.

**Q17: What is the agenda of today's session?**

**A17:** Today's session is primarily focused on Project 1, specifically on how to use LLMs with APIs.

**Q18: I've shared my URL in Discourse. Can you please check it when you have time?**

**A18:** Yes, I will check your URL.

**Q19: I created my project code by generating a GitHub repo, enabling GitHub pages, and pushing code. Is this correct, or is there more to do?**

**A19:** Yes, those steps are correct. Your code should have functions for creating the repo, enabling pages, and pushing. The main chunk of Project 1 that is still pending is **writing the code with the LLM**. Today's session will focus on filling in that part.

**Q20: Can you show us the solution code for Project 2 from the last term so we can get an idea of what to do for Project 1?**

**A20:** Yes, I can show you the last term's Project 2 solution to give you an idea of what's expected. Most of the core functions are already available from the October 4th session, but there might be some logical adjustments needed based on your specific implementation.

## Part 2

Here's the FAQ for the second part of the tutorial:

---

**Q21: I'm working on Grader Assignment 3 (GA3), and for the fifth question, I'm encountering an error stating "no rolling session markers in my log." I'm not sure what this means or how to resolve it, as I'm just pasting the log content.**

**A21:** This error usually arises because the system has specific checks for the answers. You can find the JavaScript code that checks for all the questions within your browser's developer tools. Go to "Inspect" and then the "Sources" tab. This will show you the exact code being used to validate your answers.

**Q22: I've found the evaluation code as you suggested. How can I use it to debug the error I'm facing in GA3?**

**A22:** For each question, there's specific code that checks its answer. Copy the relevant evaluation code for your question and paste it into ChatGPT. Then, ask ChatGPT: "While solving this question, I get the following error: [paste your error here]." ChatGPT will suggest solutions. If those don't resolve the issue, feed any new errors back to ChatGPT for further assistance. I've also shared a chat with this specific question and the evaluation code to get you started.

**Q23: I've tried asking ChatGPT multiple times with different variations, but it hasn't helped me understand what the "marker" is. What should I do?**

**A23:** Try using the specific evaluation code that validates the answer when you ask ChatGPT. This provides more context for the AI. I've already shared a chat that does this, asking GPT what the issue is. It might not give you the exact solution immediately, but if you get new errors, continue feeding them back to GPT, and it should help you pinpoint and resolve the problem.

**Q24: For Question 7, I need to write a Bash command using the LLM tool, but when I ask for a prompt, the feedback I receive consistently suggests _not_ to use the LLM. How can I get a prompt that aligns with the question's requirement?**

**A24:** You can try the same debugging approach as outlined for the previous question (Q22) by providing the question's context and any feedback you've already received to ChatGPT. Alternatively, you can ask for assistance from other students on Discord.

**Q25: Regarding the CLI issue, the question states we can use any CLI, not just GitHub Copilot. For instance, it lists CodeX, Claude, Code, Gemini, and Coder CLI as options. Can I just switch to a different CLI, like Claude CLI, to bypass the quota issue?**

**A25:** Yes, you can certainly try using a different CLI if the question allows it. It's worth testing if that resolves your quota problem.

**Q26: My GitHub Copilot CLI is showing a "quota exceeded" message, and I can't complete the assignments. What are my options?**

**A26:** There are a couple of things you can try. Firstly, attempt to use a different GitHub account, perhaps one associated with a personal email address, as a temporary measure. This might resolve the "quota exceeded" error. Secondly, since the assignment allows for using various LLM tools, if you're comfortable, you could collaborate with another student. They might be able to host your code on their machine or provide you with an ngrok URL from their account, which you can then submit.

**Q27: I've already hosted my solution on ngrok, but when I send requests from the question paper, ngrok returns "quota exceeded" instead of processing the factorial calculation. What else can I do?**

**A27:** This suggests your ngrok quota might be exhausted or your GitHub account connected to ngrok is hitting a limit. Since I'm not sure why you're specifically facing this issue, I recommend asking another student if they can give you _their_ ngrok URL to use for submission. Or, you can share your code with them and ask them to host it on their local machine and provide you with the output/URL.

**Q28: Can we use Google's "Jules" for the project? It seems to do something similar to what the project topic requires.**

**A28:** Yes, if Google's Jules can perform the tasks required by the project topic effectively, you can certainly try using it.
