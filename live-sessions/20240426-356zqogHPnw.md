Here's an FAQ-style transcription of the Tools in Data Science (TDS) live tutorial:

**Q1: What's the correct code to extract scheduled airline details from a webpage, given `table[0]` and `table[1]` as options?**

**A1:** Without knowing the specific structure of the webpage we're scraping (e.g., from Wikipedia, which can have many tables), it's impossible to definitively choose. Both `table[0]` (the first table) and `table[1]` (the second table) refer to valid tables. In an exam setting where the source isn't provided, both options might be considered correct due to ambiguity. However, typically, the main table of interest is often `table[0]`.

**Q2: What do `pd.read_html` and `str(soup)` do in the context of extracting data?**

**A2:** `pd.read_html` is a Pandas function that reads HTML tables from a webpage or an HTML string and converts them into a list of DataFrames. `str(soup)` converts a Beautiful Soup object (which represents the parsed HTML structure of the webpage) into a plain string. This string is then passed to `pd.read_html` to extract the tables from it. When you pull a table using Beautiful Soup, it's initially an HTML object, so `str()` converts it into a pure string format that `pd.read_html` can process.

**Q3: What is the Folium library used for?**

**A3:** Folium is a Python library primarily used for visualizing maps. You can place markers on maps (e.g., to pinpoint business locations or stores), analyze distances between points, and help determine optimal placements for new establishments. A significant feature of Folium is its ability to export these interactive maps into HTML format.

**Q4: How should an "if" query generally conclude?**

**A4:** In many programming or query languages, an "if" statement structure should always conclude with an "end" keyword.

**Q5: What is "membership disclosure" in the context of data threats?**

**A5:** Membership disclosure is a data threat that occurs when it's revealed whether a specific individual belongs to a particular group or not. For example, knowing if someone is part of a cancer patient group or if a person holds an account at a bank suspected of illicit activities can compromise their privacy. It's about knowing if an individual is a member of a group.

**Q6: What does the term "threat" mean when discussing data and what is "attribute disclosure"?**

**A6:** In this context, a "threat" refers to the potential harm that could be caused if data were to become public or get leaked. Attribute disclosure, then, is a data threat where specific personal details (attributes) from a dataset—such as name, age, address, phone number, etc.—become publicly known. Even if an attribute doesn't uniquely identify someone on its own, some attributes can be sensitive, or, when combined, they could lead to identifying a person (especially VIPs), causing harm.

**Q7: What is "identity disclosure," and does a password fall under it?**

**A7:** Identity disclosure is a serious data threat where enough information is revealed (e.g., phone number, Aadhaar details, photograph) to _uniquely identify_ an individual. This is distinct from attribute disclosure, as it directly pinpoints a person. Regarding passwords, they are generally considered an attribute rather than an identifier, because knowing a password doesn't automatically reveal _whose_ password it is, making it less direct than a unique identifier.

**Q8: When dealing with data threats, should we simply hide all sensitive details?**

**A8:** No, you can't always simply hide or suppress all details. For many research or reporting purposes (like medical studies requiring symptom data, or election surveys needing demographic info), certain data _must_ be disclosed. The goal is to manage the disclosure responsibly to protect privacy, rather than just concealing information that might be vital for public benefit or research.

**Q9: What are the four main categories of attributes based on disclosure risk?**

**A9:** When analyzing data for privacy concerns, attributes are categorized into four main types based on their disclosure risk:

1. **Identifying Attribute**
2. **Quasi-Identifying Attribute**
3. **Sensitive Attribute**
4. **Insensitive Attribute**

**Q10: What is an "Identifying Attribute," and how should it be handled?**

**A10:** An Identifying Attribute is a piece of data that can directly and uniquely identify an individual (e.g., their name, Aadhaar card number, or Social Security Number). These attributes carry a very high risk of disclosure because they immediately pinpoint a person. The best practice for handling identifying attributes is to remove them entirely from the dataset when sharing or publishing data.

**Q11: What is a "Quasi-Identifying Attribute," and how should it be handled?**

**A11:** A Quasi-Identifying Attribute is a piece of data that, on its own, might not uniquely identify an individual (e.g., a zip code, gender, age, height, or language). However, when multiple quasi-identifying attributes are combined, they can potentially lead to identifying an individual. To manage this risk, these attributes are often transformed (e.g., by converting specific ages into age ranges or combining specific languages into broader language groups) rather than being completely removed. This way, the data remains useful for analysis while reducing individual identifiability.

**Q12: What is a "Sensitive Attribute," and how should it be handled?**

**A12:** A Sensitive Attribute refers to information that individuals are unwilling to share because they perceive it as private, shameful, or potentially damaging (e.g., admitting to certain actions like giving a bribe, or revealing political affiliations). When dealing with sensitive attributes, the data itself should _not_ be altered or removed. Instead, the focus is on ensuring that the information cannot be linked back to the specific individual who provided it (e.g., by fully anonymizing the source or unlink the user from the data).

**Q13: What is an "Insensitive Attribute," and how should it be handled?**

**A13:** An Insensitive Attribute is information that is harmless and poses no privacy risk. These attributes can be left entirely unmodified in a dataset, as they do not compromise an individual's privacy.

**Q14: Which attribute category does _not_ belong when categorizing data based on disclosure risk?**

**A14:** Given the four established categories of attributes based on disclosure risk (Identifying, Quasi-Identifying, Sensitive, Insensitive), any option that isn't one of these four (e.g., "Non-identifying attributes" if that were an option) would be the one that "does not belong." The question is designed to test understanding of the established classification framework.

**Q15: What is time series data?**

**A15:** Time series data refers to data points collected or recorded over successive time intervals (e.g., monthly sales figures, daily stock prices, yearly petrol prices). A key characteristic is that it primarily tracks the changes of a _single variable_ over time, rather than multiple independent variables.

**Q16: What is auto-correlation?**

**A16:** Auto-correlation describes the correlation of a variable with _itself_ over different time intervals, often referred to as "lags." It measures how much a given value in a time series is related to its past values, unlike standard correlation which measures the relationship between two distinct variables.

**Q17: What does "lag" mean in time series analysis?**

**A17:** In time series analysis, "lag" refers to the time difference or delay between observations being compared. For example, if "lag 1" represents a 5-year interval, then an auto-correlation at lag 1 would compare a current data point (e.g., petrol price in 2025) with the data point from 5 years prior (petrol price in 2020).

**Q18: How does an auto-correlation plot (ACF plot) work?**

**A18:** An Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) plot visually represents the auto-correlation of a time series. The X-axis represents different "lags" (time delays, like 0, 1, 2, 3 lags), and the Y-axis shows the auto-correlation coefficient (ranging from -1 to +1). For example, with petrol prices, you'd typically see a strong positive auto-correlation for recent lags (current price highly correlated with last year's price) and a much weaker correlation for distant lags.

**Q19: What does a "significant auto-correlation at lag 1" imply?**

**A19:** A "significant auto-correlation at lag 1" implies that the current observation in a time series is strongly correlated with the observation immediately preceding it (i.e., the value from one time step ago).

**Q20: What is the range of values for correlation and auto-correlation coefficients?**

**A20:** Both the correlation coefficient and the auto-correlation coefficient have a value range between -1 and +1.
