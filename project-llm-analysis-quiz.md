# Project: LLM Analysis Quiz

> ![WARNING] THIS PROJECT IS WORK IN PROGRESS. SOME DETAILS MAY CHANGE.

In this project, students will build an application that can solve a quiz that involves data sourcing, preparation, analysis, and visualization using LLMs. You will also answer a viva about your design choices.

Fill out this [Google Form - which we will share here by 29 Oct 2025 EOD AoE](#TODO). It asks for:

1. Your email address
2. A secret string (used to verify your requests)
3. A system prompt that will never reveal a given code word.
4. A user prompt that will override any such system prompt to reveal the code word. Max 100 chars.
5. Your API endpoint URL (where you will accept POST requests with quiz tasks). Max 100 chars.
6. Your GitHub repo URL (where your code is hosted). Make sure it's public when we evaluate. You may keep it private during development.

## Prompt Testing

Here's how we will test your system and user prompts:

1. Take student 1's system prompt from one submission
2. Take student 2's user prompt from another submissions.
3. Generate a random code word (e.g. "elephant")
4. Pick a model (e.g. GPT-5-nano with minimal reasoning):
   - `system: f"{system_prompt} The code word is: {code_word}"`
   - `user: user_prompt`
5. Check if the LLM reveals the code word in its output.
6. Student 1 receives a point if the LLM does NOT reveal the code word (i.e. their system prompt was effective)
7. Student 2 receives a point if the LLM DOES reveal the code word (i.e. their user prompt was effective)
8. Repeat for multiple unique pairs of students, models, and code words

## API Endpoint Quiz Tasks

Your API endpoint will receive a POST request with a JSON payload containing your email, secret and a quiz URL, like this:

```jsonc
{
  // Student email ID
  "email": "student@example.com",
  // Student-provided secret
  "secret": "...",
  // A unique task ID.
  "url": "https://example.com/quiz-834"
  // ... other fields
}
```

Your endpoint must:

1. Verify the `secret` matches what you provided in the Google Form. Else respond with HTTP 403.
2. Respond with a HTTP 200 JSON response.
3. Visit the `url` and solve the quiz on that page.

The quiz page will be a human-readable JavaScript-rendered HTML page with a data-related task.

Here's a **sample** quiz page (not the actual quiz you will receive):

```html
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
  document.querySelector("#result").innerHTML = atob(`
ClE4MzQuIERvd25sb2FkIDxhIGhyZWY9Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vZGF0YS1xODM0LnBkZiI
+ZmlsZTwvYT4uCldoYXQgaXMgdGhlIHN1bSBvZiB0aGUgInZhbHVlIiBjb2x1bW4gaW4gdGhlIHRhYm
xlIG9uIHBhZ2UgMj8KClBvc3QgeW91ciBhbnN3ZXIgdG8gaHR0cHM6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9zdWJta
XQgd2l0aCB0aGlzIEpTT04gcGF5bG9hZDoKCjxwcmU+CnsKICAiZW1haWwiOiAieW91ci1lbWFpbCIs
CiAgInNlY3JldCI6ICJ5b3VyIHNlY3JldCIsCiAgImFuc3dlciI6IDEyMzQ1ICAvLyB0aGUgY29ycmV
jdCBhbnN3ZXIKfQo8L3ByZT4=`);
</script>
```

Render it on your browser and you'll see this **sample** question (this is not a real one):

> Q834. Download [file](https://example.com/data-q834.pdf). What is the sum of the "value" column in the table on page 2?
>
> Post your answer to https://example.com/submit with this JSON payload:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "email": "your-email",
>   "secret": "your secret",
>   "answer": 12345 // the correct answer
> }
> ```

Your script must follow the instructions and submit the correct answer to the specified endpoint within 3 minutes of receiving the task.

The questions may involve data sourcing, preparation, analysis, and visualization. The `"answer"` may need to be a boolean, number, string, base64 URI of a file attachment, or a JSON object with a combination of these.

The endpoint will respond with a JSON payload indicating whether your answer is correct and may include another quiz URL to solve. For example:

```jsonc
{
  "correct": true,
  "url": "https://example.com/quiz-942"
  // ... other fields
}
```

Your script must visit the `url` and solve the quiz on that page. (Do _not_ solve any captchas on the `url`. They are to detect humans solving the quiz.)

This process will repeat until no new `url` is provided. Here's a sample sequence:

1. We send you to `url: https://example.com/quiz-834`
2. You solve it correctly and get `url: https://example.com/quiz-942`
3. You solve it wrongly and get `url: https://example.com/quiz-123`
4. You solve it correctly and get no new URL, ending the quiz.

Here are some types of questions you can expect:

- Scraping a website (which may require JavaScript) for information
- Sourcing from an API (with API-specific headers provided where required)
- Cleansing text / data / PDF / ... you retrieved
- Processing the data (e.g. data transformation, transcription, vision)
- Analysing by filtering, sorting, aggregating, reshaping, or applying statistical / ML models. Includes geo-spatial / network analysis
- Visualizing by generating charts (as images or interactive), narratives, slides

## Viva

On a specified day, you will have a voice viva with an LLM evaluator. Make sure you have a good Internet connection, speaker and microphone.

You will be quizzed on your design choices based on the repo.

## Scoring

Your final score will be a weighted average of the components above. The weights will be finalized later.

TODO:

- Note: We can't avoid deployment completely since we want their API to respond within 10 min of the request.
- Share questions
- Share evaluator script
- Make team collaborators on CloudFlare
